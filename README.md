# This is my pet-projects

I tried to make a medical clinic app. I did not implement such pages like "News" and "About". I decided to finish that project at this stage because I wanna start some news project for improwing my skills in the React ant others. 

## This is what I used when developing this program

### `Firebase` `Ant design` `moment.js` `styled.js` `FontAwesome` `React-Router-Dom` `redux toolkit`

### I hope someday I will return to this repository Ð°nd I feel nostalgia for my inexperience
